<h1>Dynamic Variables</h1>
<p>One of the most basic needs is to provide status information back to the user of 
your web application.  The HTTP server provides for this using <i>dynamic 
variable substitution callbacks</i>.  These commands in your HTML code will
alert the server to execute a callback function at that point.</p>
<p>To insert a dynamic variable, place the name of the variable inside of the tilde
(<code>~~</code>) character, like this: <code>~~myVariable~~</code>.  When that 
sequence is found, the server will call the function <code>HTTPPrint_myVariable()</code>.</p>

<p>For example, here's the build date of the HEX file programmed in your part:</p>

<div class="examplebox code">~builddate~</div>

<p>You can also pass parameters to dynamic variables by placing numeric values inside 
of parenthesis after the variable name.  <code>~~led(2)~~</code> will print the value
of the second LED.  The numeric values are passed as WORD values to your callback function.
You can pass as many parameters as you wish to these functions, and if your C code has 
constants defined, those will be parsed as well.</p>

<p>As an example, here is a binary representation which LEDs are on and off on the board:</p>

<div class="examplebox code" style="letter-spacing: 10px">
~led(7)~ ~led(6)~ ~led(5)~ ~led(4)~ ~led(3)~ ~led(2)~ ~led(1)~ ?
</div>

<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise:</b> Try to add the last (LSB) LED to the output above.</p>

<p>For short outputs (less than 16 bytes) you need only to call the appropriate 
<code>TCPPut</code> function and return.  For longer outputs the output state must be 
managed through successive calls, which prevents the limited buffer space from being 
overrun.</p>
<p>As an example, here is the current LCD display (which uses 32 bytes):</p>

<div class="examplebox code">~lcdtext~</div>

<p>You can also use dynamic variables to include files.  This is useful to save 
storage space for your pages, since a portion of most pages (header, menu, footer) 
do not change.  By placing <code>~~inc&#058;filename.inc~~</code> in your HTML code, 
the file <code>filename.inc</code> will be read and inserted at this location.</p>
<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise:</b> Look at code for this page and find how 
<code>header.inc</code> and <code>footer.inc</code> are used.  These files provide 
a template for the pages to include the same menu, layout, and design elements.</p>
<p><small>(At this time, dynamic variables are non-recursive, so variables located inside
files<br /> included in this manner are not parsed.)</small></p>
